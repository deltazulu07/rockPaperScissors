Rock paper scissors project

(After fundamentals part 3 - 9/20/2023)

What I learned:
- how to use switch statements instead of if/else if/else clauses
- practiced writing functions in Javascript
- revisited how to write for and while loops
- practiced having 1 function only do 1 thing; use helper functions when needed
- write test functions as needed (e.g. whether a function is truly generating random numbers)
- reminder to use strict equality and inequality (=== and !==)
- using console.log() in similar ways as print statements in other languages
